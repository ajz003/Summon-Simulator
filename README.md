# Summon-Simulator

Simulates summoning new heroes in the mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes. Ideally, it'll be able to calculate the average number of orbs required to summon your desired hero. It will also be able to tell you the average amount of orbs you need to spend if you snipe for your desired unit and want to +10 it.

### Note

I've quit Fire Emblem Heroes, so any changes to summoning as of 5-19-2019 will not be accounted for. Any people who would like to maintain the codebase can feel free to make pull requests.
